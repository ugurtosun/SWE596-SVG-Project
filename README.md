# SWE-596 Project-2 Documentation
#### *Uğur Gürkan Tosun - 2019719261*

In this project, I developed a web based educational content with using HTML, JavaScript and SVG techniques. 

## Project Definition

In the project proposal, I decided to choose Java Memory Management Concept. For this purpose, I implemented total 22 story page including introduction and thanks pages.
At the top of page there is a header, and at the bottom of page there is a navigation bar. The navigation bar supports basic forward, next, previous, back functions. In addition to these user could jump any step of story if she wants.
